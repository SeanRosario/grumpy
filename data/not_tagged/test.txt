first thing early monday morning i'm gonna pack my tears away got no cause to look back i'm looking for a better day you see the thing 'bout love is that it 's not enough if the only thing it brings you is pain there comes a time when we could all make a change just let go and let it flow , let it flow , let it flow everything 's gonna work out right , <unk> know let go , and let it flow , let it flow , let it flow just let it go do not nobody want no broke heart and do not nobody want no two time losers ai not nobody gonna love you like you are if you take whatever he brings you away you see the thing of it is we deserve respect but we ca not demand respect without change there comes a time when we must go our own way sometimes love it can work out right sometimes you 'll never know but if it brings you only pain in your life do not be <unk> to let it go 
say i'm crying i'm looking at what 's on t v pain and suffering and the struggle to be free it ca not ever be denied and i never will ignore but when i see you coming i can take it all you 're so fine lose my mind and the world seems to disappear all the problems all the fears and the world seems to disappear say you 're mine and give yourself to the feelings that you know i'm needing all that you can give me all the things that you do so well words are healing sweet anticipation making <unk> as the shadows close in fall across all our yesterdays you 're so fine lose my mind and the world seems to disappear all the problems all the fears and the world seems to disappear you 're so fine lose my mind and the world seems to disappear all the problems all the fears and the world seems to disappear disappear disappear disappear disappear disappear disappear disappear say if i could look into myself and reason but i could never never see or make sense of the <unk> turn around am i looking at salvation make me realise all that i am you put the light inside this man you 're so fine lose my mind and the world seems to disappear all the problems all the fears and the world seems to disappear you 're so fine lose my mind and the world seems to disappear all the problems all the fears and the world seems to disappear you 're so fine lose my mind and the world seems to disappear all the problems all the fears and the world seems to disappear you 're so fine lose my mind and the world seems to disappear all the problems all the fears and the world seems to disappear

if i could tell the world just one thing it would be that we 're all ok and not to worry 'cause worry is <unk> and useless in times like these i wo not be made useless i wo not be idle with despair i will gather myself around my faith for light does the darkness most fear my hands are small , i know but they 're not yours , they are my own but they 're not yours , they are my own and i am never broken poverty stole your golden shoes it did not steal your laughter and heartache came to visit me but i knew it was not ever after we 'll fight , not out of spite for someone must stand up for what 's right 'cause where there 's a man who has no voice there ours shall go singing my hands are small i know but they 're not yours , they are my own but they 're not yours , they are my own i am never broken in the end only kindness matters in the end only kindness matters i will get down on my knees , and i will pray i will get down on my knees , and i will pray i will get down on my knees , and i will pray my hands are small i know but they 're not yours , they are my own but they 're not yours , they are my own and i am never broken my hands are small i know but they 're not yours , they are my own but they 're not yours , they are my own and i am never broken we are never broken we are god 's eyes god 's hands god 's mind we are god 's eyes god 's hands god 's heart we are god 's eyes god 's hands god 's eyes we are god 's hands we are god 's hands 
it starts with one thing , i do not know why it does not even matter how hard you try keep that in mind , i designed this rhyme to explain in due time all i know time is a <unk> thing watch it fly by as the <unk> swings watch it count down to the end of the day the clock ticks life away , it 's so unreal did not look out below watched the time go right out the window tried to hold on , but did not even know i wasted it all just to watch you go i kept everything inside and even though i tried , it all fell apart what it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when i tried so hard and got so far but in the end it does not even matter i had to fall to lose it all but in the end it does not even matter one thing , i do not know why it does not even matter how hard you try keep that in mind , i designed this rhyme to remind myself how i tried so hard in spite of the way you were <unk> me acting like i was part of your property remembering all the times you fought with me i'm surprised that it got so far things are not the way they were before you would not even recognize me anymore not that you knew me back then but it all comes back to me in the end i kept everything inside and even though i tried , it all fell apart what it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when i tried so hard and got so far but in the end it does not even matter i had to fall to lose it all but in the end it does not even matter i put my trust in you pushed as far as i can go for all this there 's only one thing you should know i put my trust in you pushed as far as i can go for all this there 's only one thing you should know i tried so hard and got so far but in the end it does not even matter i had to fall to lose it all but in the end it does not even matter 
by the time i get to <unk> she 'll be rising she 'll find the note i left hangin' on her door she 'll laugh when she reads the part that says i'm leavin' 'cause i 've left that girl so many times before by the time i make <unk> she 'll be working she 'll prob'ly stop at lunch and give me a call but she 'll just hear that phone keep on ringin' off the wall that 's all by the time i make oklahoma she 'll be sleepin' she 'll turn softly and call my name out loud and she 'll cry just to think i 'd really leave her tho' time and time i try to tell her so she just did not know i would really go 
out of the <unk> out from the <unk> ca not make the same mistakes this time we are the children the last generation we are the ones they <unk> behind and i wonder when we are ever gonna change it living under the fear till nothing else remains we do not need another hero we <unk> need to know the way home all we want is life beyond the <unk> looking for something we can rely on there 's got to be something better out there love and compassion their day is coming all else are castles built in the air and i wonder when we are ever gonna change it living under the fear till nothing else remains all the children say we do not need another hero so what do we do with our <unk> we leave only a mark will our story shine like a light or end in the <unk> is it all or <unk> we do not need another hero all the children say we do not need another hero we do not need another hero
