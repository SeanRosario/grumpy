some love is just a lie of the heart , the cold remains of what began with a passionate start and they may not want it to end , but it will , it 's just a question of when i 've lived long enough to have learned , the closer you get to the fire , the more you get burned but that wo not happen to us , because it 's always been a matter of trust i know you 're an emotional girl it took a lot for you to not lose your faith in this world i ca not offer you proof , but you 're going to face a moment of truth it 's hard when you 're always afraid , you just recover when another belief is betrayed so break my heart if you must it 's a matter of trust you ca not go the distance , with too much resistance i know you have doubts , but for god 's sake do not shut me out this time you 've got nothing to lose you can take it , you can leave it , whatever you choose i wo not hold back anything , and i 'll walk a way a fool or a king some love is just a lie of the mind it 's make believe until its only a matter of time and some might have learned to adjust , but then it never was a matter of trust i'm sure you 're aware love , we 've both had our share of , believing too long , when the whole situation was wrong some love is just a lie of the soul a constant battle for the ultimate state of control after you 've heard lie upon lie , there can hardly be a question of why some love is just a lie of the heart the cold remains of what began with a passionate start but that ca not happen to us because it 's always been a matter of trust it 's a matter of trust it 's always been a matter of trust it 's a matter of trust it 's always been a matter of trust it 's a matter of trust
